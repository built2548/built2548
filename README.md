# Hi there, I'm Chisanucha Uthai! üëã

I'm a third-year **Computer for Communication** student at **College of Social Communication Innovation Srinakharinwirot universityt**.

I'm passionate about building digital experiences and solving problems. I have experience in **Mobile App Development (Swift)** and **Web Development (WordPress)**, and I am currently teaching myself **Game Development (Unity)** and **3D Modeling (Blender)**.

I am actively seeking an internship opportunity where I can apply my skills and learn from real-world projects.
